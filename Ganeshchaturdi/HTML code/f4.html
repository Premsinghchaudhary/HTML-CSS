<p>
	The combination of an elephant head with a human body is one of the unique physical features of Lord Ganesha. In this avatar, the Lord defeated the demon of greed, Lobhasura, who was the son of Lord Kuber. Gajanana mounts a mouse in this avatar. Kubera once visited Kailasa. There he was blessed with the vision of the Lord and Goddess Parvati. Parvati was so beautiful that Kubera looked at her with lustful eyes. The Mother became angry at this, and Kubera shivered with fear. From the fear of Kubera, there manifested a demon named Lobhasura. Lobhasura descended to the world of Asuras, where he received his education from Sukracharya. He was initiated into the mantra “Om Namah Shivaya”. The demon then performed penance and in due course the Lord appeared and blessed him with the boon of fearlessness.
