<h1> Vakratunda- The Curved Trunk </h1>
<img src="C:\Users\91721\OneDrive\Pictures\1.webp">
<p>
	If you see Ganesha pictured with a curved trunk, you can assume this is a celebration of Ganeshaâ€™s first lifetime.<br> Basically, Vakratunda was the Ganesha who slayed the demon Matsarasura, and his vehicle is the lion on which<br> he is seated. Matsarasura was and still is a symbol of jealousy. Thus symbolically, Ganesha/Vakratunda is the <br>god who destroys and overcomes the destructive power of jealousy.
