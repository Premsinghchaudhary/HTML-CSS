<p>
	Ganesha’s ever-present obesity is emphasized in this particular manifestation. For the Ganapatiya devotees, who consider Ganesha as the Supreme God and the Master of the Universe, the sweet given as offerings are seen like seeds of innumerable worlds inhabited by innumerable living creatures, and the god’s belly is large enough to contain within all these worlds and creatures. The Lambodara avatar of Ganesha is considered to be similar to Shakti, the pure power of Brahman. Lord Ganesha incarnated as Lambodara with the objective to eradicate the demon of anger known as Krodhasura.
