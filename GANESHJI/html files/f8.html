	His life mission this time around was to defeat the demon Ahamkarasur, the demon of self-infatuation.<br>
It is worth noting that the word “Aham” means the human ego. Aham is the demonic force which grips <br>the human mind like a vice, with cruelty and deception, and never let go until the very bitter end. <br>Like a parasitic worm Aham is so entrenched in the psyche, the human host eventually thinks that<br> this is all that s/he can identify with. This demon has also been called Ahamkarasur, or Abhimanasur, <br>both words again pointing to the inextricable control of the ego on the human.
