	In this avatar, he had four arms, one tooth, a huge belly and his head was like an elephant. Once Parashurama had visited Lord Shiva and wanted darshan of him. But Ganesh refused him entry and they challenged each other to a fight. During the fight Parashurama struck Ganesh’s tusk with his divine weapon Parashu, Ganesh lost his tusk. Ganesh could have avoided the blow but he knew that the Parashu was a gift from Lord Shiva. So he took the blow of the Parashu as a sign of respect and devotion and lost his tooth. Ganesha later used this tusk to script the epic Mahabharata. He acted as a scribe to SageVed Vyas . A mouse is his mount or vahana in this avatar. In this avatar, Lord Ganesha fought against the demon Madasura, who was the embodiment of conceit and arrogance.
