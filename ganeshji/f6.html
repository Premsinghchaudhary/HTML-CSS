<p>
	This manifestation of Lord Ganesh is renowned for the subjugation of Kamasura; who was the personification of lust. <br>The Devas were quite miserable as Kamasura had also become the leader of the three Lokas. Lord Ganesh in his<br> Vikata form came and helped the Devas gain salvation. Interestingly, Ganesha traded in his Mouse Vehicle to ride<br> a peacock in this manifestation.
